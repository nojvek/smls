SMLs (Simple Markup Languages)
====

Pronounced (smiles). The web uses languages such as css, html, json to communicate declarative structures to the computer.

Like JQuery we want to **write less, do more.** 

After using preprocessors like emmet, yaml, jade, and stylus, this is an effort to produce a single parser that can transpile to/from json, html and css.

* [SON](SON.md) -> transpiles to JSON
* [SML](SML.md) -> transpiles to HTML
* [SSS](SSS.md) -> transpiles to CSS
